#+TITLE: TODOs
* Add license
* New method to get latest WOD
- Currently, the latest WOD is found using today's date and predicting the title
- Sometimes the tiles are unpredictable (such as for holidays)
- Is there a way to get the latest url from the [[http://crossfitph.com/wod-blog/][wod blog page]]?
- If so, then it wouldn't matter what the wod title was - this could just pull the nth WOD from the top
