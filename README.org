#+TITLE: Crossfit PH Scraper

This Python script finds and formats the text of the latest workout at Crossfit Potrero Hill. It then prints out that text and copies it to the clipboard. I use it to keep my own records of the workouts I do.

To run:
: python3 crossfit_ph_scraper.py

You can add an optional numerical argument to get previous workouts. Add 1 for every day you want to go back. For example, this will return the workout from 2 days ago:
: python3 crossfit_ph_scraper.py 2

Requirements:
- Python3
- BeautifulSoup4

Note that the copy to clipboard functionality has only been tested on Mac OS.
