#+TITLE: Crossfit PH Scraper

This Python script pulls the text of the latest workout at Crossfit Potrero Hill. I use it to keep my own records of the workouts I do.

To run:
: python3 crossfit_ph_scraper.py

You can add an optional numerical argument to get previous workouts. Add 1 for every day you want to go back. For example, this will return the workout from 2 days ago:
: python3 crossfit_ph_scraper.py 2

Requirements:
- Python3
- BeautifulSoup4
